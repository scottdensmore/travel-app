# travel-app Workspace Agent Rules

These rules govern all feature, fix, refactor, documentation, and maintenance
work in this repository. All agents and sub-agents must follow them.

## Development Workflow

1. **Inspect before changing anything.** Inspect the repository, current Git
   state, and all applicable instruction files before making changes. Preserve
   unrelated staged, unstaged, and untracked work.

2. **Create a branch first.** Create a dedicated feature, fix, refactor, chore,
   test, or documentation branch before making code changes. Never commit
   directly to `main`, and create the branch from the latest appropriate
   `main` state.

3. **Choose a thin vertical slice.** Before implementing a roadmap item or
   feature, define the smallest end-to-end slice that can be reviewed, tested,
   shipped, and merged independently. Prefer one coherent user-visible or
   operational outcome over a broad horizontal layer. If the next roadmap item
   is too large for one pull request, split it into ordered slices and complete
   only the current slice. Keep pull requests small enough for thorough review,
   reliable verification, and quick rollback.

4. **Use test-driven development when behavior or structure is testable.**
   - Add or update a focused test before implementation.
   - Run it and confirm it fails for the expected reason.
   - Implement the smallest appropriate change.
   - Run focused tests while iterating.
   - Refactor only while the relevant tests remain green.

5. **Inspect the complete diff.** Review the branch diff plus all staged,
   unstaged, and untracked files. Remove accidental or unrelated changes while
   preserving work that belongs to the user.

6. **Run `ui-review` before verification.** After the main agent completes an
   implementation pass, invoke the `ui-review` sub-agent. The `ui-review`
   sub-agent must act as an expert in website design, usability,
   responsiveness, and accessibility. Address every actionable finding before
   running the `verifier`. For UI-affecting changes, exercise the changed
   journey in the rendered application at representative phone, tablet, and
   desktop viewports; inspect interaction, loading, empty, error, focus,
   keyboard, contrast, and responsive states as applicable; and capture
   screenshots or equivalent visual evidence. For changes with no UI impact,
   explicitly record that rendered UI review is not applicable. If a finding
   is not applicable, record the concrete reason rather than silently ignoring
   it.

7. **Run `verifier` before code review.** Invoke the `verifier` sub-agent to run
   the builds, static checks, tests, and journey coverage appropriate for the
   change. The verifier must report failures, flakes, missing coverage, and
   environment issues. Fix or explicitly resolve every actionable finding
   before starting code review. If a verifier finding requires a code change,
   rerun the verifier after addressing it.

8. **Run `code-review` before every commit.** Invoke the `code-review`
   sub-agent against the current branch diff and every staged, unstaged, and
   untracked file. The reviewer must act as an expert in the languages and
   frameworks used by this application, including TypeScript, React, Next.js,
   Prisma, PostgreSQL, Jest, and Playwright. Address every actionable finding
   before committing. If review findings cause changes, rerun the appropriate
   tests and the `verifier`, then obtain a fresh `code-review` approval for the
   changed state.

9. **Commit after approval.** Commit only after verification and code review
   are complete. Use Conventional Commits:

   ```text
   <type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>
   ```

   Keep the subject at 72 characters or fewer, describe why in the body when
   useful, and do not combine unrelated work.

10. **Create pull requests from the reviewed state.**
   - Confirm that local verification remains valid.
   - Rerun `code-review` only if the reviewed state changed after the pre-commit
     review.
   - A changed state includes code, tests, documentation, generated files,
     conflict resolution, or any other staged, unstaged, or untracked content.
   - Do not repeat code review when the already-reviewed diff and worktree
     remain unchanged.
   - Push and create the pull request only after local verification and any
     required code review are complete.

11. **Merge only clean, passing pull requests.** Merge only after GitHub
    reports a clean merge state and every configured check passes. Never bypass
    a failing or pending required check. Self-merges are allowed when these
    conditions are met. Use squash merge for short-lived development branches
    to keep `main` linear, then delete the merged branch.

## Testing Expectations

- Preserve all existing tests and add coverage for new behavior and
  regressions.
- Add functional coverage for complete user journeys when a change crosses
  component, server, database, or authentication boundaries.
- Use Jest and Testing Library for focused unit/component/integration tests and
  Playwright for browser journeys.
- Mock true external boundaries in focused tests; use realistic local services
  for end-to-end verification where appropriate.
- Treat warnings, flakes, skipped checks, and environment failures as findings
  that require an explicit resolution.

## Roadmap Tracking

- Use `REAL_WORLD_ROADMAP.md` as the source of truth for real-world hardening
  work.
- Reference the applicable roadmap item ID in implementation plans and pull
  requests.
- Check off an item only after its acceptance criteria are met and verification
  passes.
- Add the completion date, PR number, and a short note to the roadmap progress
  log.
- Include roadmap updates in the same reviewed state as the implementation
  that completes them.

## Containerization Fallback

- Docker and Docker Compose are preferred when available.
- If Docker or Docker Compose is unavailable or fails because this machine uses
  Podman, fall back to `podman` and `podman-compose` respectively.
